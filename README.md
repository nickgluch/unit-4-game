# unit-4-game
this project generates a random number on page load and then assigns a value to each crystal image
and the goal of a the projects game is to add the crystal values to the current value and to match it with
the random number
if the score matches the random number the win counter will go up 1
if it goes past the random number the loss counter will go up 1

My approach to developing this program was to create a random number variable, a win and loss variable to hold the count of how many times a user has won or lost, and a current score to hold and show the users score. Then create images that when clicked increase the score by a certain amount. Then create a function to check if the score is equal to the random number and if it is then the user wins; and a function to check if the score is greater than the random number and if it is then the user loses. Then reset the score on a win or loss.
